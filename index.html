            <p>Hello, I am Jos√© Cantero, I am from Chile. My wife is Isidora Amigo and I have a son, his name is Mateo Cantero.</p>
            Here are some things about me: I started learning code because I love programming. In my free time, I like to spend time with my family and friends. 
            I really enjoy playing sports, running, and going to the gym. 
            Lately, I have been very busy with raising my son and helping my dear wife.</p>

            <img src="images/chilemap.jpg" alt="Chile is located in South America" width="200">
            <p>My country is a long and narrow country and is located in South America. We talk Spanish as the primary language. We have a lot of different foods and people from many parts of the world. My country has nearly 20 million inhabitants and is growing rapidly. 
                Even so, we are still about 20 years away from becoming a developed country like the United States. </p>
